<a id="death-note">Death Note</a>

This anime starts out incredibly strong. The setup is amazing. One of the best ever.

Some of my favorite scenes:
• Light explaining his Death Note hiding & self-destroying contraption
• Introduction (discovery, explanation, and verification) of the first few Death Note rules

However, as the episodes carry on, the addition of rules and somewhat predictable tactics become boring.

Some questionable scenes:
• Light declining the "Shinigami eye" deal
  → why? this would make things so. much. easier.
• Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, saving his daughter, Sayu, by trading a Death Note
  → so predictable, yet felt really far fetched. kidnapping card should never be played in this show. makes incentives too simple.

I have decided to stop watching this show further once L died. After sitting through the next 3 episodes, I feel less captivated by the story line. Although the set up is pretty good (one Death Note is now in the hands of Mello), I find the possibilities of where this might lead quite predictable. Light will keep on winning, no matter how hard the show tries to make you feel like he's been caught. I believe this is "a feature not a bug" moment, because for the show to go on, Light must win. The day he loses is the day the show ends.</details>
When the show begins, it feels like L and Light are playing chess. The rules are simple, yet the game is incredibly unpredictable. As the story progresses, the "structure" and "simplicity" of chess breaks down; the plot becomes a bit convoluted and the strategies not super clear. Maybe this is an unavoidable effect of entropy.

On a scale of "worth watching" or "not worth watching," this show gets a <span class="verdict verdict-watch">WORTH WATCHING</span>.
